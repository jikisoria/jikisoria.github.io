        This was during the Sinulog 2015. We went to Ayala with Agnes, Leigh, and Ading. We ate some food and took some pictures. I think it was the first time we went out somewhere far and went home late. We were still kinda shy at the time, but our bond was starting to grow and the day went fine. The whole day was tiring as we had to walk the entire time, but it was definitely fun and worth it.

        We were with a few friends in 7-11 Sawang that was recently established. This was probably a schedule B where we can leave the school a little early. That is why we were the only customers at that time, so we took advantage of taking a few pictures hahaha. We were so cute in this batch of pictures. We are always cute in most pictures hahaha.

        Invited by Loubel for his birthday celebration. It was my first time eating pizza in S&R lol. After we ate, I remember we went to a photobooth in timezone and took two sets of pictures. We were a bit shy because the booth is open and strangers were passing by while we were taking the pictures hahaha. The pictures we took were good, obviously as we were and still are kyot hahaha. We had fun and that day went well.

        The Vault in Greenery Mabolo. This place was a board and card games cafe. This was the first time I met your SHS classmates. I was really shy in conversing with them. My first impression of them was that they were really smart and I was right. We discovered games we've neve played before and I got to meet your classmates.

        Exactly 3 years ago today. Your birthday, our anniversary. We celebrated that day painting and drinking a bottle of wine. You used to paint back then. You encouraged me to paint and it was really interesting, unfortunately I wasn't able to continue. Thank you for sharing the opportunity to paint with you. I still have my painting that day, how about yours?

        Sinulog 2020. Just a few months before the pandemic hit us. We were at Ivan's infamous Valiant Office hahaha. Drinking a few bottles of rum while playing UNO with friends. You painted my arm with multiple sharingans to look like Danzo using acrylic paint. And then we took some photos while facing the light of the projector, those photos turned out pretty amazing.

        Ahh yes Ayala again hahaha. We changed our outfit at the last minute, unexpectedly wearing the same outfit color hahaha. We were suppose to babysit Ryam with her friends, but decided to leave them at it since they'll be fine without us.  We went to our favorite machine in timezone - the photobooth. After taking the pictures, we went to the Terraces loitering, talking, and having fun.

        The first of many. The first time we were able to have a sleepover out of town with friends. A lot of things happened that day - drinking, eating, swimming, taking photos. It was a surprise that our conservative parents allowed us to. I kinda overdid some things, but overall we really had fun. I look forward to having more days like this in the near future.
